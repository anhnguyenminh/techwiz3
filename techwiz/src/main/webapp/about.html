    <div class="about">
      <p>Thrift Fashion is Australia’s largest online fashion thrift store. We resell second hand clothes, shoes, and
        fashion accessories on behalf of Australian girls and women at our online thrift shop. During our first 18
        months of operating our online thrift store, we have listed more than 4,000 second hand fashion items on our
        online thrift store and processed more than 15,000 kg of used fashion items.</p>
      <p>It is our mission to help reduce the devastating impact of non-sustainable fashion consumption by:</p>
      <ul class="pharagraph">
        <li>Providing a single online thrift shop for shoppers of exceptional quality pre-owned fashion apparel whilst
          saving them up to 90% of what they would have paid for the same items at the shopping mall</li>
        <li>Assisting Australians to responsibly rehome their unwanted and surplus fashion items and earning spare cash
          from their sales</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 15px;">Help save our planet</h2>
      <p>Every day, billions of us buy clothes, shoes, and handbags with not a single thought about where they came from
        or where they will go to once we have used them a few times or very often, not worn them at all. The statistics
        relating to the consumption of fashion are staggering. </p>
      <p>
      <ul class="pharagraph">
        <li>Every year, the fashion industry emits more than 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere</li>
        <li>Australia produces 800,000 tonnes of textile waste each year, that is 32 kg of waste per person</li>
        <li>Australians throw away 23kg of the 27kg of the textiles we buy every year. We consume 60% more fashion than
          we did in the year 2000 but every item is kept only half as long</li>
        <li>It is expected that by the year 2050, we will need 3 times as many natural resources to keep up with demand
          for new fashion</li>
        <li>It is estimated that only 10% of donations to thrift stores are sold.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We are killing our world. Quoting legendary campaigner, Sir David Attenborough, at a recent UN summit on
        climate change, ““Right now we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands
        of years: climate change,” he said. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the
        extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.”</p>
      <p>More people buying and wearing second hand means less waste. If many people make small changes, the combined
        effect will be positive. We simply need to produce less, buy less, and throw away less. </p>
      <p>Do your bit. Take care of your garments and shoes. Wear them longer and recycle.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 15px;">Buying from us</h2>
